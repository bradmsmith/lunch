<h2>The Power Behind Your Campus Lunch</h2>
<p><strong>By Shane Rouland</strong></p>
<p>When you do a campus lunch at your high school, you are fulfilling the great commission of Jesus Christ! He says in Matthew 28:19-20, “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.” It is awesome we have the opportunity to obey this command from 2,000 years ago at our high school campuses today!  You can preach the gospel to as many people as possible, and you should! But fundamentally, you cannot change anyone’s heart, that saving work only God can do!</p>
<p>The Bible is very clear that men cannot save themselves by works, but only God can do the work of saving someone from their sins (Ephesians 2:8-10). As you go out and preach that message to high schoolers on your campus, you need to remind yourself of that as well! Just like you cannot save yourself from your sins, you cannot save anyone else from their sins. Since God is the only one who can save we need to spend time asking him to do it.  We need to pray!</p>
<p>Prayer is the power behind any ministry at your high school. As you go out and spread Jesus Christ on your campus and lift high his name, your prayers go out before you and have an affect on peoples lives. Its just like a car, although it may seem as if I am in control of it, because I am driving, I am not in complete control of the car that I am driving. I can steer it and speed it up, but when you open up the hood, you see behind the scenes there is something that is actually making this car run. It has an engine and all of these different intricate parts that I don’t fully understand, but I know that they are essential to making the car run. Your prayers are essential to making your campus lunch effective. You can go out and tell whoever you want to come and hear the gospel of Jesus Christ, but there is something behind the scenes that you cannot do, and that is enter into that persons heart and save them. Only God has the power to go behind the scenes into someone’s life and fundamentally change them on the inside. Which is exactly why prayer is vital to your campus lunch, because it calls on the power of God to change peoples lives and do the work behind the scenes that we cannot.  You need to show your absolute dependence on God to save people, and you do that through prayer!</p>
<p>The good news is God wants to save people! We see that in 1 Timothy 2, which says, “First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.” In 1 Timothy 2:1-6, the apostle Paul tells us to pray for people to be saved! And he tells us to pray for salvation because it is God’s desire for people to be saved! When we pray for God to save we can know our desires are lined up with his. And if we pray according to God’s will, then we can know for certain that our prayers are being heard (1 John 5:14-15). That is an amazing thing when you think about it! The Almighty Creator of the Universe is hearing your prayers! If he created the universe in six days, don’t you think he can create eternal life in someone’s heart in an instant? God is able to save people, thats not the question, the question is do you want him to save someone bad enough that you are willing to spend “your” time praying for it.  Will you do this every day?  Will it become a passion for you?</p>
<p>There are some very important things you need to pray for when it comes to your campus lunch.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pray for God to be glorified</strong></p>
<p>In high school’s all over America right now God is not glorified. His name has been reduced from hallowed, and has now become habitual sin for people, as they take it in vain everyday. Gone are the days, when people respect God, and fear him like they should. Just walk around your high school campus and instead of seeing praise and worship to God, you will see profanity and idolatry to this world. Do you want to be a part of the movement that lifts high God’s name on high schools all across America? Then you need to start praying for God’s name to be glorified and lifted high through the preaching of his word at your campus lunch. And let me just tell you that when you start praying like this, all of a sudden your prayers will start becoming more passionate and genuine, as you get the focus off of yourself and onto God. You will realize how great God is and how he deserves all glory, honor, and praise and you want to give it to him! And not only do you want to give it to him, but you want your fellow classmates to give it to him! If you want that, then it is time to get down on your knees and start praying for God to be glorified!  This is after all, how Jesus taught us to pray in Matthew 6:10!</p>
<p><strong>2. Pray for salvation</strong></p>
<p>This prayer request seems like a no-brainer, or even a big duh! But be careful, when you are running a campus lunch it is very easy to get caught up in all of the logistics and planning and forget to pray for the most important thing; people to get saved. 1 Timothy 2:1-4 is a clear command that you need to pray for people to get saved! This means that every day and before every time you guys meet on campus, you need to be praying for salvation through your lunch. And this needs to be the center of your prayers, because God is glorified when people get saved! It is a great idea to have prayer meetings with fellow Christians on your campus who can meet together, to ask that God would save people at your school. And if you do not have any other Christians at your school, it is smart to set aside a specific time to really pray for God to save.</p>
<p><em>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.”</em> Philippians 4:6</p>
<p><strong>3. Pray for the logistics</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot that goes into your campus lunch, whether it is the school’s approval of your meetings, the teacher who is going to help you by hosting your Christian club, or getting the free food there on time.  Whatever small detail that you think is not a big deal, it needs to be prayed about. Pray about it all, and let God know that you trust in his sovereignty and need him to work out all of the details. You would be foolish not to work hard to get your campus lunch details all worked out and running smoothly, but ultimately God is in control of everything that happens at your campus lunch, so show him that you want him to be in control, and ask that he would work out all of the logistics. Pray because God is in control, but work as if he wants you to do it. You need to work hard on your campus to make sure that your campus lunch is running at the highest level it can, but ultimately you need to recognize that at the end of the day God is in control, and you need to cast all of your requests to him, because he will work it out. God is sovereign, so trust him!</p>
<p>Jesus says in Matthew 7:7-11, “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!” This is the ultimate encouragement to pray! Jesus says, that when you ask it will be given to you. Take Jesus up on his promise, and ask him to lift his name high at your high school, ask him for salvation through your campus lunch, and ask him to work out all of the details behind the scenes! Besides being saved yourself, I don’t know if there is any better gift then getting to be a part of someone else’s salvation. Jesus Christ will use you when you ask him to, and it is an amazing experience when he does, just ask him.</p>
<p>What good is knowing all of this though, if you don’t actually start praying for your campus lunch? I have tried to give you enough encouragement to actually start praying passionately, and I have tried to give you a decent idea of what to pray for! So go do it! Pray for your campus lunch, and Jesus will hear those prayers! To have a successful campus lunch, you need to pray for it. I want to end with a few words from Martyn Lloyd- Jones from his book Revival, he says this, “we need a power that can enter into the souls of men and break them and smash them and humble them and then make them anew. And that is the power of the living God. And we must be confident that God has this power as much today as he had one hundred years ago, and two hundred years ago, and so we must begin to seek the power and to pray for it. We must begin to plead and yearn for it.” Do you want to see people get saved? Then show God, and ask him to save. God can save people at your school, and he wants to save people at your school, now is the time for you to make a commitment to start praying and pleading with God for salvation!</p>
<p>If you want to be a part of the movement that lifts high Jesus’ name on high school campuses, then you need to be a part of the movement that gets down on their knees every night for asking for God to save! Souls at your high school need to be saved right now, you cannot save them, only God can, ask him to do that work right now!</p>
